//if character is obtained, then display them; 
//then stats vary with level + relics; so addition; 
//display of other stats ???????
//import characters from another file; then import info from the gacha???; then use if else statements to display each character (colored if obtained; greyscale if not).
//we can either change "obtained" to true when we get the char, or we can push those in a new array; the former seems more efficent
